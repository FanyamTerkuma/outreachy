# Introduction

Hello everyone, My name is Terkuma, pronounced 'Taykuma'. I am from Nigeria and I am a web developer, front end to be specific. I usually work with HTML, CSS,Tailwind and ReactJS. My adventure doesn't stop there, I am currently learning python programming language.

In my personal time, I prefer to listen to podcasts, some of my favorites are [Science Vs](https://open.spotify.com/show/5lY4b5PGOvMuOYOjOVEcb9?si=1f69031662694af2), [Hidden Brain](https://open.spotify.com/show/20Gf4IAauFrfj7RBkjcWxh?si=4de1667450404c77), [TechLinked](https://open.spotify.com/show/1cBhYjm2fildfRsNDEYLcm?si=e6394557c24242fc) and [Easy German](https://open.spotify.com/show/2rnCPyV8A9J80QtmGj2pAx?si=3da7e20bfd4d4b72) Podcast. Listening to music is another activity I really love to do. I listen to a lot of pop these days and some of my favorites in the genre are Post Malone, TheWeeknd and Halsey. [Austin](https://open.spotify.com/album/6r1lh7fHMB499vGKtIyJLy?si=sg7qFdOPRzadXPMxPm3R1Q), by Post Malone, is an album that has been on my radar for a while now. Occasionally, I get involved in physical activities like running or playing badminton.


As a newcomer to the Outreachy program, I'm brimming with excitement and curiosity. For me, it's more than just an opportunity; it's a gateway to acquiring new skills, forging connections with fellow contributors and mentors, and contributing meaningfully to the open source community. I can't wait to get to know you all better. :)

It can be a broad area or a very narrow subject. It doesnâ€™t have to be about tech. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).
